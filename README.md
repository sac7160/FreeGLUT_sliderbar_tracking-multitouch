# FreeGLUT_sliderbar_tracking-multitouch   
   
***   

This repository is part of perceived haptic research.    
And this is experimental code still under development.     
will be continuously updated.   



The main function is divided into three parts.   
1. implementing **slider bar**   
2. **tracking two-points-touch input**  and print the coordinates in console window.   
3. sending the content by using **Serial communication** when mouse pressed or a touch event occurs.        
   
   
아직 불필요한 코드,오류 많음..
